##This code is able to compress png, jpg, and heic formats. Resizes the image to fit within specified pixel range - set max_pixels. (Set to 100 megapixels)
##pngs end up larger than original file size, but you can set the image resolution. for .jpg file compression, set 'quality' from 0-95 (95 is highest quality)
