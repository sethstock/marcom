##This code is able to compress png, jpg, and heic formats. Resizes the image to fit within specified pixel range - set max_pixels. (Set to 100 megapixels)

from PIL import Image

# Increase the maximum image pixels limit
Image.MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS = None

def compress_image(input_path, output_path, max_pixels=100_000_000):
    try:
        # Open the input image
        img = Image.open(input_path)
        
        # Get the original dimensions
        original_width, original_height = img.size
        original_pixels = original_width * original_height
        
        # If the image is already under the max pixels, save it as is
        if original_pixels <= max_pixels:
            img.save(output_path)
            print(f"The image is already under {max_pixels} pixels. Saved without resizing.")
            return
        
        # Calculate the scaling factor to get the image under the max pixels
        scaling_factor = (max_pixels / original_pixels) ** 0.5
        new_width = int(original_width * scaling_factor)
        new_height = int(original_height * scaling_factor)
        
        # Resize the image
        img = img.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.LANCZOS)
        
        # Save the resized image
        img.save(output_path)
